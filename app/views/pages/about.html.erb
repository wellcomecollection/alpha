Our primary goals are to</p><ul><li>show all the free digitised content so you can get a taste of what's available</li><li>give&nbsp;historical context for the creators, subjects and&nbsp;collections held in Wellcome Library</li></ul><p>We are digitising as much of our collection as we can and putting it online. We are also importing digital books from the UK Medical Heritage Library, Medical Heritage Library (USA) and other selected&nbsp;research institution partners. This rapidly growing digital collection includes materials covering more than 99,000 subjects and 233,000 creators. Have a look around and let us know what you uncover.</p><p>What is an alpha?</p><p>We've released this as an alpha website&nbsp;which means that it is a work-in-progress. During 2016, we will gather more information about how people are using the website to explore our collections. We will also set out&nbsp;what technical and data requirements we must meet before it has all the stability, functionality and content to help you make the most of the library.</p><p>GET ME OUT OF HERE</p><p>If you want to do a comprehensive <a href="http://wellcomelibrary.org/search-the-catalogues/"></a><a href="http://wellcomelibrary.org/search-the-catalogues">catalogue search</a>, find out about <a href="http://wellcomelibrary.org/visit-us">visiting the Library</a>, or discover what else we offer, pleasevisit our official website at <a href="http://wellcomelibrary.org">wellcomelibrary.org</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>To find out more about the early days of this alpha site, visit our <a href="http://whatsinthelibrary.wordpress.com">What&#39;s In The Library?&nbsp;project blog</a>.</p><p>GET INVOLVED</p><p>If you&#39;d like to be part of our alpha user group, or have any comments or questions about our progress, please get in touch.</p><ul><li>Email <a href="mailto:librarywebeditorial@wellcome.ac.uk>LibraryWebEditorial@wellcome.ac.uk</a></li><li>Tweet us @wellcomedigital #alpha</li></ul></body></html>
