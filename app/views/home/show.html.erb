<h1>Welcome to Week 4!</h1>

<p>Our work this week is about Scalability. We're hoping to take the work of the previous three weeks - <a href="http://scope.whatsinthelibrary.com">scope</a>, <a href="http://thing.whatsinthelibrary.com">show the thing</a> and <a href="http://context.whatsinthelibrary.com">context</a> - and bundle it together in a fourth exploration. We're curious to see how we can enrich the MaRC across 962,000 records programmatically. </p>

<p>We've making a list of <a href="/people">People</a>.</p>
